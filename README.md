# ZKU-Vote

## Overview
ZKU-Vote is a platform that allows anonymous voting. Participants can approve projects/vote for classmates/workmates without having to reveal their identity and decision, candidates can view the current results. Participants only get access to the voting page and get voting rights after the participant is verified by Discord role.

## Application type
zkDAO

## Use Case
Currently ZKU-Vote showcases the following using zk-proofs:
Anonymous voting for classmates/workmates, only students can vote.
Anonymous project approval by governors only. (5 governors needed for approval)

This app is designed to be easily modified to fit the DAOs need when it comes to anonymously taking votes. An important feature is the access being restricted to DAO members and voting rights being distributed based on the user's role within the DAO.
The aim is to have a project that can be taken apart and be useful for other developers, or to showcase the possibilities with the semaphore boilerplate from the semaphore docs.
